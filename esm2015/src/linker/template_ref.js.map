Alternatively you can query for\n * the `TemplateRef` from a Component or a Directive via {@link Query}.\n *\n * To instantiate Embedded Views based on a Template, use {@link ViewContainerRef#\n * createEmbeddedView}, which will create the View and attach it to the View Container.\n *\n */\nexport abstract class TemplateRef<C> {\n  /**\n   * The location in the View where the Embedded View logically belongs to.\n   *\n   * The data-binding and injection contexts of Embedded Views created from this `TemplateRef`\n   * inherit from the contexts of this location.\n   *\n   * Typically new Embedded Views are attached to the View Container of this location, but in\n   * advanced use-cases, the View can be attached to a different container while keeping the\n   * data-binding and injection context from the original location.\n   *\n   */\n  // TODO(i): rename to anchor or location\n  abstract get elementRef(): ElementRef;\n\n  abstract createEmbeddedView(context: C): EmbeddedViewRef<C>;\n}\n"]}
