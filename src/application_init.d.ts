 * does not complete until the Promise is resolved.
 *
 * You can, for example, create a factory function that loads language data
 * or an external configuration, and provide that function to the `APP_INITIALIZER` token.
 * The function is executed during the application bootstrap process,
 * and the needed data is available on startup.
