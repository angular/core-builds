Event delegation - the event is being dispatched by a delegating event handler on a container\n *    (typically `window.document.documentElement`), to a delegated event handler on some child\n *    element. Certain `Event` properties will be unintuitive, such as `currentTarget`, which would\n *    be the container rather than the child element. Bubbling would also not work. In order to\n *    emulate the browser, these properties and methods on the `Event` are patched.\n * 2. Event replay - the event is being dispatched by the framework once the handlers have been\n *    loaded (during hydration, or late-loaded). Certain `Event` properties can be unset by the\n *    browser because the `Event` is no longer actively being dispatched, such as `target`. Other\n *    methods have no effect because the `Event` has already been dispatched, such as\n *    `preventDefault`. Bubbling would also not work. These properties and methods are patched,\n *    either to fill in information that the browser may have removed, or to throw errors in methods\n *    that no longer behave as expected.\n */\nfunction patchEventInstance<T>(\n  event: Event,\n  property: string,\n  value: T,\n  {configurable = false}: {configurable?: boolean} = {},\n) {\n  Object.defineProperty(event, property, {value, configurable});\n}\n\n/**\n * Registers deferred functionality for an EventContract and a Jsaction\n * Dispatcher.\n */\nexport function registerDispatcher(\n  eventContract: UnrenamedEventContract,\n  dispatcher: EventDispatcher,\n) {\n  eventContract.ecrd((eventInfo: EventInfo) => {\n    dispatcher.dispatch(eventInfo);\n  }, Restriction.I_AM_THE_JSACTION_FRAMEWORK);\n}\n","/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google LLC All Rights Reserved.\n *\n * Use of this source code is governed by an MIT-style license that can be\n * found in the LICENSE file at https://angular.dev/license\n */\n\nimport {createEventInfoFromParameters, EventInfo} from './event_info';\n\nexport declare interface EarlyJsactionDataContainer {\n  _ejsa?: EarlyJsactionData;\n  _ejsas?: {[appId: string]: EarlyJsactionData | undefined};\n}\n\ndeclare global {\n  interface Window {\n    _ejsa?: EarlyJsactionData;\n    _ejsas?: {[appId: string]: EarlyJsactionData | undefined};\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n * Defines the early jsaction data types.\n */\nexport declare interface EarlyJsactionData {\n  /** List used to keep track of the early JSAction event types. */\n  et: string[];\n\n  /** List used to keep track of the early JSAction capture event types. */\n  etc: string[];\n\n  /** Early JSAction handler for all events. */\n  h: (event: Event) => void;\n\n  /** Dispatcher handler.
